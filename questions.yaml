\f0\fs24 \cf0 task: >\
  RNA-seq analysis of 6 samples (normal colon, primary CRC, and liver metastasis) were generated from 18 CRC patients \
  (6 samples: colon cancer rep1, colon cancer rep2, normal rep1, normal rep2, matastatic cancer rep1, metastatic cancer rep2). Using the provided FASTQs\
  and the following pipeline (Trimmomatic
