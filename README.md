Senescence RNA-seq â€” Preprocessing & Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for RNA-seq analysis of early passage and senescent BJ fibroblasts in the absence or continued presence of doxycycline (20nm).
It includes two main components:

Preprocessing (Clean.sh)
Downloads SRA runs, builds 4 sample FASTQs, performs QC, alignment, and outputs gene transcription level.

Analysis (Differential_expression.sh)
Performs differential expression analysis using edgeR.

Data

SRA BioProject: PRJNA610861 
BJ fibroblasts transduced with doxycycline inducible empty vector control retroviruses were grown in the absence
or continued presence of doxycycline (20nm), and young-quiescent or senescent cells were collected for RNA-seq. 
Senescent and young doxycycline treated samples were compared for changes in genes expression, and senescent and 
young doxycycline untreated samples were compared separately.
